# react-study
Notes from my React studying, or notes from progress made on projects. Basically, anything React based goes here!!

<h1>React UseState</h>

<div class="container">
import React, { Component } from "react";
import "./App.css";

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>Hi, I'm a React App</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
  </div>
